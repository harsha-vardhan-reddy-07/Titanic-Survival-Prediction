# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

* "Titanic Survival Prediction" is a classification model that helps to predict whether a person might survived or not depending upon few characteristics like Age, Sex, Ticket fare, Cabin, etc.,
*  This is a basic mini project made for educational purpose.
*  Here, I used one machine learning model for prediction.
*  We can use and compare multiple models to get a best model for our data.
*  The dataset is collected from kaggle competition.
*  As it's a basic mini project, accuracy is not upto the mark, we can imporove it by trying multiple models, tuning of hyperparameters of the model.
